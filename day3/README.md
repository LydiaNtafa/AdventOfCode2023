* Code needs refactoring for Single-Responsibility (function to check if isAdjacentToSymbol)
* Part 2 not complete
** Idea for part 2 solution- without dramatically changing the existing code: I can store the adjacent symbol (symbol, position(x,y))
and check if more numbers are adjent to a * to find their power.
